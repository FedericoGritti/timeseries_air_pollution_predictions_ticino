    "## Forecast Feature Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "The forecast features come from **COSMO meteorological models** (COSMO and COSMO-2), which provide weather predictions for the Alpine region. These are **multi-day ahead forecasts** (step0 to step5) that can be used to predict future PM10 levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base COSMO Model Features\n",
    "\n",
    "| Signal | Full Name/Description | Relevance to PM10 |\n",
    "|--------|----------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **T_2M** | Temperature at 2 meters | Higher temperatures can increase PM10 through resuspension and secondary aerosol formation |\n",
    "| **TD_2M** | Dew Point Temperature at 2m | Indicates humidity; high humidity can trap pollutants near ground level |\n",
    "| **RELHUM_2M** | Relative Humidity at 2m | High RH reduces dispersion; low RH increases dust resuspension |\n",
    "| **FF_10M** | Wind Speed at 10 meters | Higher wind speeds disperse pollutants; calm conditions trap PM10 |\n",
    "| **DD_10M** | Wind Direction at 10m | Indicates pollutant transport direction from source regions |\n",
    "| **PS** | Surface Pressure | High pressure = stable conditions = poor dispersion; low pressure = better mixing |\n",
    "| **GLOB** | Global Solar Radiation | Strong radiation drives photochemistry and vertical mixing |\n",
    "| **TOT_PREC** | Total Precipitation | Rain washes out PM10 (wet deposition); reduces concentrations |\n",
    "| **CLCT** | Total Cloud Cover | Affects radiation, temperature gradients, and mixing layer height |\n",

    "### COSMO-2 High-Resolution Features (`_c2` suffix)\n",
    "\n",
    "The features with **`_c2`** suffix come from the **COSMO-2 model**, which provides:\n",
    "- **Higher spatial resolution** (~2.2 km vs ~7 km for COSMO)\n",
    "- **Better representation of Alpine topography** (mountains, valleys)\n",
    "- **More accurate forecasts for complex terrain**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- `T_2M_c2`: High-resolution temperature forecast\n",
    "- `TOT_PREC_c2`: Fine-scale precipitation patterns\n",
    "- `PS_c2`: Localized pressure systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Meteorological Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temperature (T_2M, TD_2M)**\n",
    "- ↑ Temperature → ↑ PM10 (resuspension, secondary formation)\n",
    "- Large T_2M - TD_2M gap → Low humidity → More dust\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wind (FF_10M, DD_10M)**\n",
    "- ↑ Wind speed → ↓ PM10 (dispersion)\n",
    "- Wind direction determines if pollution arrives from industrial/urban areas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pressure (PS)**\n",
    "- High pressure systems → Temperature inversions → Trapped pollutants\n",
    "- Low pressure → Vertical mixing → Better air quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precipitation (TOT_PREC)**\n",
    "- Rain → Washout effect → ↓ PM10\n",
    "- Most effective PM10 removal mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "**Radiation & Clouds (GLOB, CLCT)**\n",
    "- Strong radiation → Convective mixing → Disperses PM10\n",
    "- Clouds → Reduced mixing → Can trap pollutants\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forecast Horizons (step0 to step5)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **step0**: Current day forecast (0 days ahead)\n",
    "- **step1**: Tomorrow's forecast (1 day ahead)\n",
    "- **step2-step5**: 2-5 days ahead forecasts\n"
