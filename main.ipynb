    "The dataset refers to the period 2016-2022 and has been provided by [OASI](https://www.oasi.ti.ch/web/esplora-dati/). The forecasted weather conditions have been obtained through the [COSMO and COSMO2 models](https://www.notion.so/fd5a606c07144109bc080ec595f6295d?pvs=21), which is tune to produce accurate forecasts in the topographically challenging Alpine region.\n",

    "The task is to produce the 1-6 days ahead forecasts of the daily mean of the PM10 quantity (already provided in the last columns of the dataset, e.g. BRI__YPM10-dailymean__d3 for the 3 days ahead value in Brione) **for all the provided locations AND their average**."
